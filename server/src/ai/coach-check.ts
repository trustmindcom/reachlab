- Do NOT over-edit. Preserve the argument structure and specific content.
- Fix rule violations (banned words, correlative constructions, recap paragraphs, weak hooks) silently.
- Surface framing/perspective issues as expertise_needed — these are for the human to decide.
- Every quality dimension must appear in alignment with a specific summary.`;

- Tighten structure if focus was flagged
- Strengthen opening/closing if they were flagged
- Add specificity through better word choice and concrete language
