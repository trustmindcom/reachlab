## Instructions

Return JSON with two fields:

1. "profile_text" — A compact paragraph (~200-250 words) written in second person ("you") as instructions to an AI ghostwriter. It should tell the ghostwriter:
   - What topics this person writes about and who their audience is
   - Their strongest opinions and contrarian beliefs (use their actual words when possible)
   - How they naturally communicate (storyteller, opinionator, data-driven, framework-builder)
   - What they NEVER want to sound like (anti-examples)
   - Any signature stories or experiences they reference repeatedly

   This paragraph will be injected into every draft prompt, so make it actionable. Example tone: "You are writing for [Name], a [role] who writes about [topics] for [audience]. They believe strongly that [opinion]. They never want to sound like [anti-example]. When explaining ideas, they tend to [style]."

2. "profile_json" — A structured object with these fields:
   - "writing_topics": array of strings — the specific topics they want to own on LinkedIn
   - "audience": string — who they're writing for and what that audience cares about
   - "strong_opinions": array of strings — beliefs they hold that most peers would disagree with, stated as "I believe X, but most people think Y"
   - "mental_models": array of strings — the 2-3 frameworks/lenses they apply repeatedly
   - "signature_stories": array of strings — concrete experiences they referenced that could anchor future posts
   - "anti_examples": array of strings — styles, tones, or patterns they explicitly want to avoid
   - "persuasion_style": string — how they naturally argue (storyteller, opinionator, data-presenter, or framework-builder)

Return valid JSON only. No markdown fences.`,
