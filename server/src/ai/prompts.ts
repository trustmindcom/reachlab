## Post Summaries
${postSummaries}

## Instructions
Return a JSON array of topic objects. Each object should have:
- "name": A short, clear topic name (2-4 words)
- "description": A one-sentence description of what posts in this category cover

## Rules
- Topics should reflect the SUBJECT MATTER of the posts, not the format (no "opinion pieces" or "thought leadership")
- Topics should be specific enough to distinguish content but broad enough that 3+ posts fit each one
- A good test: if you told someone the topic name, could they predict what the post is about?
- BAD topics: "Startup Advice" (too broad), "Venture Capital Insights" (vague), "Industry Trends" (generic)
- GOOD topics: "AI Security", "Hiring & Team Building", "Product Launches", "Conference Talks", "Vendor Evaluation"
- Aim for 5-12 categories. Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text.`;

## Instructions
For each post, return a JSON array of objects with:
- "post_id": The post ID
- "topics": Array of matching category names from the taxonomy above (1-3 topics per post)
- "hook_type": The type of hook used (e.g., "question", "statistic", "story", "bold_claim", "how_to", "list", "contrarian", "personal", "other")
- "tone": The overall tone (e.g., "professional", "conversational", "inspirational", "educational", "humorous", "provocative")
- "format_style": The format style (e.g., "short_text", "long_form", "listicle", "story", "tips", "case_study", "poll", "carousel", "video")
- "post_category": The primary category of the post. Must be exactly one of: "announcement", "opinion", "question", "personal_story", "industry_news", "how_to", "case_study", "hot_take", "other"
  - "announcement": Posts announcing personal news — new role, company launch, paper published, award received, event attendance, milestone reached. These are engagement-inflated and should be excluded from performance benchmarks.
  - "opinion": The author shares their perspective, insight, or framework on a topic. This is the most common category — if the author is expressing a view about something, it's an opinion.
  - "question": Posts primarily asking the audience a question to drive discussion
  - "personal_story": Narrative-driven posts sharing personal experiences, lessons learned, or reflections on the author's journey
  - "industry_news": Commentary on external news, trends, reports, or events — the post is primarily ABOUT something that happened externally
  - "how_to": Tactical, instructional content with steps, tips, or actionable advice
  - "case_study": Detailed analysis of a specific example, product, incident, or result
  - "hot_take": Short, punchy, contrarian or provocative statement designed to spark engagement — usually under 50 words
  - "other": Posts that don't fit the above categories

Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text.`;

## Metrics — CRITICAL

The stats report uses TWO engagement rate metrics. Understand them both:

- **Weighted engagement rate (primary)**: \`(comments×5 + reposts×3 + saves×3 + sends×3 + reactions×1) / impressions\`. This is the PRIMARY metric throughout the stats report. It weights high-signal actions (comments, shares, saves) much higher than passive likes.
- **Standard engagement rate (secondary)**: \`(reactions + comments + reposts) / impressions\`. Shown for reference alongside weighted ER.
- **Impressions (reach)**: How many people saw the content. Measures distribution and algorithmic amplification.

When referring to "engagement rate" in your analysis, ALWAYS mean the weighted engagement rate unless explicitly stating otherwise. The stats report labels these as "WER" and "ER" — translate to plain English as "weighted engagement rate" and "standard engagement rate".

**Quadrant system:** Each post in the stats report is labeled with a quadrant:
- 🏠 **Home Run**: High reach + high weighted engagement — the best posts
- ⚡ **Reach Win**: High reach + lower weighted engagement — good for distribution
- 🎯 **Niche Hit**: Lower reach + high weighted engagement — resonates deeply with core audience
- ⬇️ **Underperformer**: Below median on both dimensions

**Rules:**
- Never call a post "underperforming" based on engagement rate alone when it has above-median impressions (it's a Reach Win).
- When comparing recent vs baseline, compare BOTH median weighted ER and median impressions. If impressions are up but ER is down, say that — and explain that this is expected behavior for high-reach content.
- For "top performer" analysis, consider both the weighted ER leaderboard and the impressions leaderboard. Posts can be top performers on either dimension. Home Runs (both) are the most valuable.
- **CRITICAL for category-level analysis**: When comparing post categories, you MUST evaluate categories on BOTH median weighted ER AND median impressions. A category with low median ER but high median impressions is a REACH strategy, not a failing strategy.

## Format-Aware Benchmarking — CRITICAL

Different content formats have fundamentally different engagement profiles. The stats report includes per-format median benchmarks. You MUST compare posts against their own format's benchmark, not the overall median.

For example, if carousels have a 6.6% median weighted ER and text posts have 4%, a text post at 4.5% is performing well for its format — do NOT call it "below average" by comparing to the carousel benchmark.

**Rules:**
- Always identify a post's content format before evaluating its performance
- Compare against format-specific medians shown in the stats report
- When recommending format changes, cite the format benchmarks as evidence
- A post that is below overall median but above its format median is performing well

## Comparative Analysis — REQUIRED

When highlighting a top-performing post, don't just explain it in isolation. Compare it against:
1. Other posts with the same content type (e.g., other video shorts, other text posts)
2. Other posts with similar topics or hook types
3. Other posts published at similar times

This helps the creator understand what made THIS post different from similar ones they've published.

## Language Rules

- Never use abbreviations or internal metric names. Say "engagement rate" not "WER" or "ER".
- When referencing specific posts, describe them by their topic/hook text and include the date. **Never reference posts by ID number.**
- All numbers must have plain-English context. Don't say "0.0608" — say "6.1% engagement rate".
- Times must be in the user's local timezone as shown in the stats report.
- Don't just identify what works — explain WHY it works (referencing LinkedIn platform mechanics when relevant) and give a specific next action the author can take this week.
- Compare recent posts (last 14 days) to baseline — notice what the author is changing and whether it's working. Compare BOTH engagement rate and impressions.
- For the writing prompt analysis: reference specific post evidence. Don't make generic suggestions. Prompt suggestions should NEVER tell the user to skip or disqualify stories that don't immediately connect to personal experience. Instead, suggest that the LLM brainstorm with the user about how a given story might relate to something they've personally built, shipped, witnessed, or gotten wrong. The goal is to help the user find the personal angle, not to gate-keep which stories get written about.
