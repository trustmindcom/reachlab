# AI Insights System — Design Spec

> Transform the LinkedIn analytics dashboard from metric-first to insight-first, using an agentic LLM to analyze post performance and generate personalized, evidence-backed recommendations.

## 1. Goals

- **Primary**: Help the user understand what's working in their LinkedIn content and double down there
- **Secondary**: Surface compound patterns (topic × hook × timing) that manual analysis would miss
- **Tertiary**: Make insights evolve over time — each analysis builds on the last

### Non-goals

- Content generation (no "write this post for me")
- Real-time analysis (cached, refreshed on sync)
- Multi-user support (single creator, local SQLite)

## 2. Architecture Overview

```

### LLM Provider

OpenRouter via `TRUSTMIND_LLM_API_KEY` (OpenRouter key, format `sk-or-v1-...`). Uses Anthropic-compatible endpoint with `@anthropic-ai/sdk` — switching to direct Anthropic API later requires only changing `baseURL`.

Models:
- **Haiku** (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`): Post tagging (~$0.25/100 posts)
- **Sonnet** (`claude-sonnet-4-6`): Analysis + recommendations (~$0.07/run each)
- **Opus** (`claude-opus-4-6`): Taxonomy discovery (one-time, ~$0.15)

### Why Agentic (Not Static Prompts)

Research-backed decision (see `docs/ai-analysis-approach-research.md`):
- Static prompts can only find patterns the prompt author anticipated
- An agentic LLM with SQL tools can notice a signal, drill deeper, then control for confounders
- The CRITIC pattern (tool-grounded verification) produces substantial gains over introspection alone
- Multi-agent debate does NOT outperform simpler methods (ICML 2024)
- Self-consistency (3x sampling, majority vote) is the most cost-effective quality improvement

## 3. Database Additions

All new tables in the existing SQLite database.

```sql
-- Content taxonomy (auto-discovered by Opus)
CREATE TABLE ai_taxonomy (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,

```

## 4. AI Pipeline

### 4.1 Taxonomy Discovery (Opus, one-time + re-discovery)

**When**: First run, or when post count doubles, or manual trigger.

**Input**: All post content previews + full research context (metric hierarchy, what we're optimizing for, content pillar framework from research doc).

**Output**: 5-15 topic categories at the right granularity for the creator's actual content. Stored in `ai_taxonomy`.

**Re-discovery**: Preserves continuity — merge/split/rename existing categories, don't restart from scratch. Old tag mappings updated.

### 4.2 Post Tagging (Haiku, incremental)

**When**: After sync, for any untagged posts.

**Process**: Batch 20 posts per request. Haiku classifies each post on 4 dimensions (topics, hook_type, tone, format_style) using structured outputs (Zod schema). Tags stored in `ai_tags`.

**Cost**: ~$0.25 per 100 posts.

### 4.3 Analysis — Three-Stage Agentic Pipeline (Sonnet)

Uses `@anthropic-ai/sdk` with `toolRunner` via OpenRouter. The LLM gets two tools:

**Tool 1: `query_db`** — Executes read-only SQL SELECT against the analytics SQLite database. Schema description embedded in tool description. Results capped at 100 rows, formatted as markdown tables.

**Tool 2: `submit_analysis`** — Structured output tool the LLM calls to submit findings in a typed JSON schema.

The database connection for `query_db` is read-only (safety net).

#### Stage 1: Pattern Detection

System prompt includes:
- Pre-computed summary (~200 tokens): post count, date range, follower count, overall avg engagement
- Database schema description
- Instructions to explore freely, find noteworthy patterns
- For each pattern: state observation, generate 3+ explanations (including confounder-based), identify distinguishing SQL queries to run

The LLM runs 3-8 SQL queries iteratively, building understanding. Max 15 tool turns (safety cap).

#### Stage 2: Hypothesis Testing

Input: Stage 1 findings + domain-specific confounder checklist.

**Confounder checklist** (embedded in prompt):
- **Content confounders**: Topic/subject matter, content length, hook quality, CTA presence
- **Timing confounders**: Day of week, time of day, seasonality, posting frequency
- **Audience confounders**: Follower count at time of posting, external amplification
- **Measurement confounders**: Metric maturity (older posts had more time), impression threshold

For each finding: test alternative explanations via SQL, classify as SUPPORTED / PARTIALLY SUPPORTED / CONFOUNDED / INSUFFICIENT DATA.

Critical: confounded findings are still reported with the confounder identified (e.g., "your image posts underperform not because of format, but because they're generic tips rather than personal stories").

#### Stage 3: Synthesis + Recommendations

Input: Verified findings + uncertainty framework + feedback history.

**Self-consistency**: Run 3 independent recommendation generations, keep findings appearing in 2+ of 3 runs. Cost: ~$0.21 total.

**Evidence strength labels** (NOT percentages — research shows LLMs cluster at 80-100% regardless):
- **STRONG**: Pattern consistent across subgroups, large effect, confounders ruled out
- **MODERATE**: Pattern visible but 1-2 confounders can't be ruled out
- **WEAK / PRELIMINARY**: Small sample (<10 per group), multiple alternatives
- **INSUFFICIENT**: Too few posts or wrong variables

**Sample size guardrails** (hard rules in every prompt):
- <5 posts per group: "Potential area to explore" only
- 5-10: "Preliminary signal, based on small sample"
- 10-20: "Moderate evidence, though sample is limited"
- 20+: Standard confidence language
- Always report exact group sizes: "text posts (n=23) vs image posts (n=8)"

**Data-tiered analysis** — capabilities gated by post count:

| Tier | Posts | Capabilities |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Foundation | 10-30 | Descriptive stats, simple rankings, content type comparison with caveats |
| Patterns | 30-60 | Topic clustering, hook analysis, day-of-week analysis, initial recommendations |
| Trends | 60-120 | Temporal trends, topic fatigue, statistical significance testing |
| Prediction | 120-250 | Seasonal patterns, audience evolution, predictive engagement ranges |
| Strategic | 250+ | Multi-variable analysis, content series analysis, algorithm sensitivity |

### 4.4 Insight Lineage

Each analysis run links new insights to predecessors:
- **CONFIRMED**: Same pattern, consistent evidence (consecutive_appearances++)
- **STRENGTHENED**: Same pattern, stronger evidence or larger sample
- **WEAKENED**: Same pattern but effect size decreasing or confounders emerging
- **REVERSED**: Previous insight no longer holds
- **SUPERSEDED**: New insight replaces old with better explanation

Insights that persist across 5+ runs are flagged as highly reliable. Insights that appeared once may be noise.

### 4.5 Overview Summary Generation

After analysis completes, a lightweight Haiku call generates:
- Natural-language summary sentence ("Your engagement rate hit a 30-day high this week...")
- Top performer identification with one-line explanation
- 2-3 quick insights pulled from the analysis

Cached in `ai_overview`, served directly to the Overview tab.

## 5. API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/api/insights` | Latest cached analysis (patterns + recommendations) |
| GET | `/api/insights/overview` | AI summary for Overview tab |
| GET | `/api/insights/changelog` | What changed since last run |
| GET | `/api/insights/tags` | AI tags for all posts |
| GET | `/api/insights/taxonomy` | Current content taxonomy |
| POST | `/api/insights/refresh` | Trigger fresh analysis |
| PATCH | `/api/insights/recommendations/:id/feedback` | Record feedback (useful/not_useful/acted_on) |
| GET | `/api/insights/logs/:runId` | Full AI logs for a run (debugging) |

All insight endpoints return cached data from SQLite. No LLM calls on read.

## 6. Trigger & Caching Strategy

**Auto-trigger**: After each successful `/api/ingest` sync, if 3+ new posts since last analysis run.

**Staleness check**: Compare post count in latest `ai_runs` vs actual post count. Also check if any posts lack tags.

**No LLM calls on page load**: Dashboard always reads from cache. "Refresh" button triggers a new run.

**Cost control**: ~$0.45-0.80 per full analysis run. Monthly at daily syncs: ~$5-14.

```

## 8. Dashboard Changes

### 8.1 Overview Tab (Transform)

**Remove**: Raw KPIs without context, static "recent posts" list (→ Posts tab), engagement by content type chart (→ Coach).

**Add**:
- **AI summary card**: Natural language "what happened + why" at the top
- **KPI cards with context**: Impressions, weighted engagement rate — each with % change vs previous 30 days
- **Top performer card**: Best post this period with "why it worked" explanation from AI
- **Quick insights**: 2-3 bullet points pulled from AI analysis

**Weighted engagement formula**: `(Comments×5 + Shares×3 + Saves×3 + Sends×3 + Reactions×1) / Impressions`

### 8.2 Coach Tab (New)

Card-based, not chat-based. Research shows creators want scannable recommendations, not conversations.

**Each recommendation card shows**:
- Priority badge (HIGH / MED / LOW)
- Category label (Topic opportunity, Compound pattern, Format insight, etc.)
- Evidence strength indicator (Strong / Moderate / Weak)
- Headline (15 words max)
- Detail with specific numbers, sample sizes, and post references
- "Try next" action with specific suggestion
- Feedback buttons: Useful / Not useful / Done

**"What Changed" section** at the bottom:
- CONFIRMED: Pattern still holds (Nth consecutive run)
- NEW SIGNAL: Pattern emerging with early data
- REVERSED: Previous insight no longer true
- RETIRED: Previous recommendation withdrawn

**Key design principle**: The AI never says "X outperforms Y" without stating effect size and sample size, and flagging when confounders can't be ruled out. Honest uncertainty is more valuable than false confidence.

### 8.3 Post-Level Annotations

On the Posts tab, each post gets inline badges from AI tags:
- Topic tags
- Hook type
- Performance indicator (above/below/at average)
- Notable metrics (e.g., "12 saves — 4x your avg")

## 9. Observability

Every LLM call logged to `ai_logs` with full inputs, outputs, tool calls, token counts, and duration. This enables:
- Seeing exactly what SQL queries the agent ran
- Tracing the reasoning chain for any recommendation
- Comparing outputs across model versions or prompt iterations
- Re-running Stage 3 (synthesis) with different prompts without re-running analysis
- Debugging why a specific recommendation was generated or not

Stage 1 and Stage 2 outputs stored separately from Stage 3. Analytical reasoning doesn't clutter the dashboard.

## 10. Feedback Loop

Store recommendation feedback in the `recommendations` table. Include feedback history in future LLM prompts:
- Don't repeat dismissed recommendation types
- Weight towards categories the user finds valuable
- Track which recommendations led to action

## 11. Environment & Configuration

AI features gated behind `TRUSTMIND_LLM_API_KEY` env var. No API key = no AI features, dashboard works as before with static metrics.

Server `.env` file (gitignored):
```
TRUSTMIND_LLM_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
```

## 12. Cost Estimates

| Operation | Estimated Cost |
|-----------|---------------|
| Taxonomy discovery (Opus) | ~$0.15 (one-time) |
| Classify 100 posts (Haiku) | ~$0.25 |
| Pattern detection + verification (Sonnet) | ~$0.14 |
| Recommendations with 3x self-consistency (Sonnet) | ~$0.21 |
| Overview summary (Haiku) | ~$0.03 |
| **Total full analysis run** | **~$0.63** |

Monthly at daily analysis: ~$5-14. With prompt caching on subsequent runs: ~$0.25/run.
